# Remote Collaboration Platform
Created a Remote Collaboration Platform, I call it teamFlow, that allows a team to work together in real-time. The platform uses collaborative document editing, allowing multiple users to edit documents simultaneously and efficiently. 

Technologies
	• Django Restful APIs: For backend services and API design.
	• PostgreSQL: For the relational database.
	• React/Redux: For the frontend interface.
	• WebSocket's, WebRTC: For connecting the document information
	
and in the future using AWS S3 buckets for storage.

Example Use Case
	• User A signs up and creates a new project.
	• User A invites User B to collaborate.
	• User A and User B start a session or chat
	• Both users edit a shared document in real-time.
All changes and interactions are seamlessly handled through the designed APIs and stored securely in AWS S3 and Post gres SQL.
